            <h2>MY self</h2>
            <p>this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different.</p>

        <h2>became a programmer</h2>
        <p>Well, the life of a programmer is quite dense â€“ most programmers spend much of their time writing code using the computer language and thinking on how to solve problems such as testing and solving for bugs in the code or thinking of how to create a new feature. It doesn't mean at all that other jobs are serene.</p>
